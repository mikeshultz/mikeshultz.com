Summary: Very rudimentary test of a dodgeball concept with the HTC Vive

I threw this together because I needed something other than [Tanks4Nothin](https://www.tanks4nothin.com) to work on for a bit.  Just started playing around with this concept.  Turns out there's other published ones out there already, so it ended up just being a playful test to get a feel for the Vive.
