Summary: Testing how a rigged player model in Unity might mimic the HTC Vive player.

Just fooling around to see how well a low-effort rigged model might mimic someone wearing the HTC Vive.  Got head and arm tracking, but it would likely take some significant work to get those arms to move properly.  Otherwise, they tend to fold up in ways that arms really shouldn't.
